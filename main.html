    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

    <p>
        Becoming a software developer has been a personal goal driven by a passion for problem-solving,
        creativity, and the desire to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology. The ability to
        create innovative solutions, build impactful software, and continuously learn in this dynamic field
        motivates me to pursue a career as a software developer. I find joy in turning ideas into functional
        and efficient code, and I am excited about the endless possibilities and challenges that come with
        being part of the software development community.
